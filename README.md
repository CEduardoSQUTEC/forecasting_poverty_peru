## Description

To strive forward in the economic growth of developing countries, there is an imperative necessity to acquire reliable and specific socioeconomic indicators. Traditional methods such as surveys are highly expensive and infrequent in time and space. As a response to the current situation, this project is looking to apply cutting edge computer vision algorithms for predicting poverty from multi-spectral satellite images. Recent developments in the field of remote sensing suggests the opportunity of applying multi-scale pre-training for dense prediction tasks such as well-being prediction. The model will predict the income and asset index of different Peruvian districts. We aim to develop a model for automatic analysis of satellite images, in this regard our expected contributions are:

- A novel method for predicting poverty that take advantage of the multi-spectral information of satellite images by pre-training the model with a multi-scale architecture.

- Our future findings should demonstrate the power of pre-trained transformers in dense satellite prediction tasks. In addition, the model results will show significant improvement over previous poverty prediction studies.

- The introduction of predictive results from unexplored developing countries. As stated in the literature, it is important to evaluate the modelsâ€™ performance in different countries.
